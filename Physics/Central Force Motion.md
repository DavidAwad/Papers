## Central Force Motion
### David Awad



**A Sample Question Question **

A $$$2kg$$$ mass on a frictionless table is attached to one end of a massless spring. The other end of the spring is held by a friction- less pivot. The spring produces a force of magnitude $$$3r$$$ newtons on the mass, where $$$r$$$ is the distance in meters from the pivot to the mass. The mass moves in a circle and has a total energy of $$$12 J$$$.

**a) Find the radius of the orbit and the velocity of the mass.**

For motion in a circular orbit for this mass that's connected to a spring. 

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

Using sum of forces, since the only force acting on the mass is the spring force, we have $$$kr = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$$. 

###### multiply by r
$$ mv^2 = kr^2 $$

###### substitute into E for $$$mv^2$$$

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{1}{2}kr^2 = kr^2$$

$$ E = 12J = kr^2 $$

######We're told in the problem that the force is of magnitude $$$3r$$$, meaking $$$k$$$ is 3. 

$$ 12J = 3r^2 $$

$$ r = 2m $$

For the velocity, we can simply use the relation from the sum of the forces, (sometimes called the equillibrium relation). 

$$ kr = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

$$ v_0 = \frac{kr^2}{m} $$

###### $$$k=3N/m, r=2m,  m=2kg$$$

$$v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{6m}{s}}$$


**b) The mass is struck by a sudden sharp blow, giving it instantaneous velocity of $$$1 m/s$$$ radially outward. Show the state of the system before and after the blow on a sketch of the energy diagram.**

Before the blow, we have a total energy such as the following:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{1}{2}kr^2 $$

But taking into account, this new impulse, it's extending the block radially outward. So we can simply add 1 meter per second in kinetic energy.

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{1}{2}kr^2 $$


$$ \delta{E} = E + \frac{1}{2}m v_f^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}kr_i^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv_\theta^2 + \frac{1}{2}m = \frac{1}{2}k_f^2  $$



And afterwards it oscillates about this new, augmented equillibrium.
