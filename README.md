# Papers
A pile of all of the papers, notes, tutorials and pieces of information I've written.


### How to use
These papers were almost all written in Mou, a pure markdown editor for OSX. Unfortunately this means that the source markdown won't render correctly for non mac users. 

I've included the markdown for you to download and make changes to if you wish, but this unfortunately means that you'll have to do a bit of editing.
